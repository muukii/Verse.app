Verse is a YouTube subtitle player built for learning with video: follow subtitles, jump instantly, and practice line by line without losing your place.

KEY FEATURES

▸ Smart Subtitle Display
Watch YouTube videos with synced subtitles displayed alongside the player. The current subtitle is highlighted, so you never lose your place.

▸ Tap to Jump
Tap any subtitle line to instantly jump to that moment in the video. Perfect for replaying phrases you want to practice.

▸ Auto-Scroll Tracking
Subtitles automatically scroll to follow playback. Manual scrolling temporarily pauses tracking, and you can resume with a single tap.

▸ Playback Speed Control
Adjust speed from 0.25x to 2.0x to match your learning pace. Slow down for difficult sections or speed up when reviewing.

▸ A-B Repeat & Loop
Set A and B points to repeat any section. Great for shadowing, pronunciation practice, and drilling key phrases.

▸ Step Playback
Step Mode automatically pauses at the end of each subtitle cue so you can listen one line at a time.

▸ Translation & Explanations (supported devices)
Translate and explain subtitle lines and words to improve understanding. You can also request explanations for selected text with context.

▸ Vocabulary List
Save words you care about and organize meanings, examples, and notes (AI autofill requires supported devices).

▸ Playlists
Group videos from your history into study playlists.

▸ Watch History
Your recently watched videos are saved automatically with thumbnails and titles. Quickly resume where you left off.

▸ Shortcuts & Siri Support
Open videos directly from Shortcuts app or via Siri voice commands.

▸ In-App YouTube Browser
Browse YouTube directly within the app and open any video with subtitles instantly.

▸ Learn even without captions (supported devices)
If captions are unavailable, you can generate subtitles with on-device transcription (where supported).

Perfect for:
• Language learners studying English, Japanese, and more
• Students watching educational content
• Anyone who prefers reading along with video

Notes:
• Some features (explanations/AI autofill, on-device transcription, etc.) require supported devices and system settings.
